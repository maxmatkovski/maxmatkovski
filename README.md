## 🧠 Featured Projects

#### 🚨 [AI Phishing Detector](https://medium.com/@maxmatkovski/ai-phishing-detector-autonomous-agent-via-claude-4-and-mcp-model-context-protocol-3f0df1b7edef)  
Autonomous phishing-detection system powered by **Claude 4 + MCP**, **Gmail API**, **VirusTotal**, and **n8n** orchestration.  
Uses an AI agent to autonomously analyze, triage, and classify sophisticated phishing emails in real time.

#### 🌿 [NLP Climate Change Sentiment Analysis](https://medium.com/@maxmatkovski/natural-language-processing-of-100-000-climate-change-tweets-120260675ce8)  
Analyzed 100,000 tweets on climate change using **BERT** for multilingual sentiment classification.  
Revealed polarization in climate discourse through data cleaning, tokenization, and visualization.

#### 💧 [Predicting Water Potability Using Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@maxmatkovski/predicting-water-potability-using-machine-learning-4cc3e55125fc)  
Classified water as potable vs. non-potable using **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** on Kaggle data.  
Compared imputation and balancing techniques to identify key chemical predictors of potability.

#### 🃏 [Monte Carlo Simulation of Blackjack](https://github.com/maxmatkovski/Monte-Carlo-Blackjack)  
Simulated 1M Blackjack games to find optimal hit strategies via **Monte Carlo methods** in Python.  
Visualized player/dealer distributions and found hitting on 15–16 yields the most balanced win rates.
