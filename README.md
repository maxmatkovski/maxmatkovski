#### 💧 [Predicting Water Potability Using Machine Learning](https://medium.com/@maxmatkovski/predicting-water-potability-using-machine-learning-4cc3e55125fc)  
**Medium article** exploring how **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** can classify water as **potable vs. unpotable** using a Kaggle dataset of 3,276 water samples.  
- Explores data preprocessing, **class imbalance handling (SMOTE, undersampling)**, and **feature importance**  
- Compares multiple imputation methods (mean, median, mode) and evaluates **model performance metrics**  
- Concludes that **Random Forest with median imputation and balanced dataset** provides the best recall for underrepresented classes
